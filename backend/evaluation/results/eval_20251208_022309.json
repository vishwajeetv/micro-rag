Institution Birthplace modifier Birthplace depending on game rules Historical Plausible Artillery The invention of gunpowder in Song China led to the development of a new device that would employ its firepower in warfare, the artillery. Although it spread throughout Eurasia in the 13th Century, its use as a common weapon system did not happen until the 15th century, as improvements in the cannon length and gunpowder recipe made artillery much more powerful, now posing a threat to stone-built castles and fortifications, the most common in Europe. Soon artillery would be used not only in sieges but also on battlefields, as smaller caliber guns now featured the mobility required to be quickly deployed and used. Its final development as a key warfare system would come in the 18th Century, especially after Napoleon perfected its use at key points during battles. \n\u2022 +50% Local Cannon Output Constantinople \n\u2022 Professional Armies institution present \n\u2022 Gunsmith \n\u2022 Tools Guild \n\u2022 Country's societal values are at least 20 towards Offensive Confessionalism Catholicism has been regarded as a unitary entity for a long time, but the advent of the various Protestant Faiths has put an end to that. With the rise of a myriad of different interpretations of what the Faith should be, Christianity is anything but united. But where before any deviance from the Church could be easily labeled as heretic, now the lines creating the differences have become blurrier at least. \nAs such, there has been an increasing interest both for religious and secular authorities alike to clearly define the shapes of their specific confessions, enforcing their particular rules and views on all aspects of faith and life. This allows them a more firm grip on the faith of their population, but also increases the differentiation and thus animosity with all the other confessions. \n\u2022 +100% Local Pop Conversion Speed\u00a0% Augsburg \n\u2022 Printers Shop \n\u2022 Town or City \n\u2022 Religion is Catholicism \n\u2022 Country's primary religion is Catholicism \n\u2022 Country's societal values are at least 25 towards Spiritualist Global Trade Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web. \nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants, and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the Southeast Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures.

A shift occurred in the Middle Ages, encouraged by the renewed growth of long-range commercial activities on the Eurasian continent and its peripheries. \nSpecialized moneylenders began to organize when Jewish communities started operating between the Christian and Islamic worlds. However, the boom of credit demand that followed the Crusades in the 12th century encouraged merchants in the Italian city-states to create larger structures for money lending, effectively founding the first Banking institutions, such as the Peruzzi and Bardi houses. \nMore instruments were developed, like bills of exchange and debt bonds, and Banking dynasties such as the Medici, Fugger or Welser soon became as powerful as States. \n\u2022 +1% Local Monthly Prosperity Genoa \n\u2022 Region is Europe, Middle East or North Africa \n\u2022 Over 1000 Burghers population \n\u2022 Country's societal values are at least 50 towards Capital Economy Renaissance Starting now in the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the Italian City states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers. \nAs a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy, and music.

In some regions, however, states were powerful enough to finance standing armies, with professional soldiers who would be available for duty throughout the year. \nThis system was also developed in Europe after the outbreak of the Hundred Year's War, being one of the main changes that promoted a Military Revolution in the Early Modern Age.

However, it depended on some individuals and their family groupings or on the Ancient States. A shift occurred in the Middle Ages, encouraged by the renewed growth of long-range commercial activities on the Eurasian continent and its peripheries. \nSpecialized moneylenders began to organize when Jewish communities started operating between the Christian and Islamic worlds. However, the boom of credit demand that followed the Crusades in the 12th century encouraged merchants in the Italian city-states to create larger structures for money lending, effectively founding the first Banking institutions, such as the Peruzzi and Bardi houses. \nMore instruments were developed, like bills of exchange and debt bonds, and Banking dynasties such as the Medici, Fugger or Welser soon became as powerful as States. \n\u2022 +1% Local Monthly Prosperity Genoa \n\u2022 Region is Europe, Middle East or North Africa \n\u2022 Over 1000 Burghers population \n\u2022 Country's societal values are at least 50 towards Capital Economy Renaissance Starting now in the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the Italian City states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers. \nAs a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy, and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Classical philosophers. Renaissance Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. \nA true Renaissance Humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music, and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals. \n\u2022 +0.5 Local Cultural Influence Florence \n\u2022 Region is Emilia or Lombardy \n\u2022 Location is a city or has an university Professional Armies Armies have existed since war was invented, many thousands of years ago. However, their form has changed over the centuries and different types of recruitment and organization have developed in different cultures and periods. \nIn the Late Middle Ages, armies in a wide range of societies relied on levies based on the structures of feudal society, with knights and footmen forming a core that was levied seasonally. In some regions, however, states were powerful enough to finance standing armies, with professional soldiers who would be available for duty throughout the year. \nThis system was also developed in Europe after the outbreak of the Hundred Year's War, being one of the main changes that promoted a Military Revolution in the Early Modern Age. Increasing the size and quality of Professional Armies, while finding new sources of revenue to finance them, soon became one of the main challenges for rulers around the world. \n\u2022 +50% Monthly Manpower Paris \n\u2022 Region is Europe \n\u2022 Has manpower \n\u2022 Country's societal values are at least 10 towards Quality",
        "Age of Discovery Institution Birthplace modifier Birthplace depending on game rules Historical Plausible New World The discovery of the New World has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, but it has also led to the spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vastness of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Atlantic, the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy. With foreign lands and people being mapped and documented, ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate are increasingly being colored by what we have found in overseas societies. Great minds feel the need to question what was once truth, and from Valladolid to Fatehpur Sikri, the nature of the world is now up for debate. \n\u2022 +50% Monthly Sailors Sevilla \n\u2022 Region is Western Europe or North Africa \n\u2022 Country has discovered the Azores, Canary Islands, or South Macaronesia \n\u2022 Has a port \n\u2022 Over 2000 Burghers population \n\u2022 Dominant culture is the county's primary culture Pike & Shot A new type of warfare began to develop at the end of the 15th Century, in the midst of the Italian Wars. The generalization of pikemen in the Late Middle Ages as an alternative to men-at-arms who could successfully face heavy cavalry charges was accompanied by the development of portable firearms, mainly matchlock arquebuses and muskets. The soldiers now adopt a new formation, in which the pikemen form a square, while the arquebusiers fan out to the sides and front, and seek cover behind or inside the square in case the formation enters close combat. This new type of formation, called Pike & Shot, was favored by German Landsknechts and Spanish Tercios, and was soon adopted by other armies, reigning supreme on European battlefields for nearly two centuries, until superseded in the early 18th Century by line infantry formations armed with new flintlock muskets mounting bayonets. \n\u2022 +20% Local Weaponry Output Innsbruck \n\u2022 Region is Europe or North Africa \n\u2022 Has manpower \n\u2022 Professional Armies institution present \n\u2022 Country has the Gunpowder advance \n\u2022 Country has more than 20% Army Tradition \n\u2022 Country's societal values are at least 20 towards Land Printing Press The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men such as Venetian Printer Aldus Manutius, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures. \nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout Europe, hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from Religious and Political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page. \n\u2022 +5% Local Max Literacy Mainz \n\u2022 University \n\u2022 Produces at least 5 Paper \n\u2022 Over 1000 Burghers population \n\u2022 Country's societal values are at least 20 towards Innovative \n\u2022 Renaissance institution present",

      "question": "How does exploration work in EU5?",
      "answer": "Exploration in EU5 is how you reveal Terra Incognita (unknown parts of the map) within your naval range.\n\nKey mechanics:\n- **Fog of war vs. Terra Incognita**\n  - You only see locations you\u2019ve discovered; everything else is **Terra Incognita (TI)**.\n  - Some areas are **Permanent TI (PTI)** and can never be explored or colonized (e.g. extreme deserts, tundra, etc. \u2013 per jargon definition).\n\n- **Starting an exploration**\n  - You can start explorations:\n    - From the **Geopolitics** tab, or  \n    - By **right\u2011clicking on Terra Incognita** that is within your **naval range**.\n  - Each exploration **requires a character** to lead it.\n\n- **Costs**\n  - To launch an exploration of an area:\n    - **100 Gold** upfront\n    - **250 Sailors** if the area is made up of sea zones\n    - **250 Manpower** if the area is made up of land\n  - There is a **monthly upkeep of 10 Gold** while the exploration is running.\n\n- **Preparation time**\n  - Base preparation time is **270 days**.\n  - This prep time is **reduced by the Diplomatic ability** of the character leading the exploration.\n\n- **Duration of the expedition**\n  - Once started, an exploration takes **a number of years** to complete.\n  - Duration depends on:\n    - **Distance from your capital**\n    - **Terrain** of the locations being explored\n  - You can **shorten the duration** by:\n    - Increasing your **naval range**\n    - Using a leader with higher **Military ability**\n\n- **Explorers**\n  - **Explorers** are special characters with **explorer traits**.\n  - They can be recruited **after the \u201cExplorer Commissions\u201d advance** has been researched.\n\n- **Discovery rewards (Old World \u2192 New World)**\n  - The **first time** a country whose **capital is in Europe, Asia, or Africa** discovers an **area in America**, it gains:\n    - **+20 Prestige**\n    - **+5 Research Progress**\n    - A **scaled amount of Gold** (amount depends on some scaling factor, not detailed here).\n\n- **Related systems (from feature videos)**\n  - Exploration ties into:\n    - **Colonial Ambition**: settling new worlds by investing pops, gold, and time, with risks like disease and indigenous resistance.\n    - **Global Trade**: discovering and controlling **New World trade goods** (e.g. sugar, tobacco) to fuel your economy.\n    - **Nation-specific strengths**: coastal powers (e.g. Portugal) are naturally better at this, while landlocked nations must \u201cinnovate to compete.\u201d",
      "contexts": [
        "Exploration \nEach country can only see on the map the locations it has discovered. Other locations will appear as Terra Incognita. Countries can reveal Terra Incognita areas that are within its naval range via exploration, which costs 100 Gold, 250 Sailors if the area is made up of seazones and 250 Manpower if the area is made up of land. Each explorations has a monthly upkeep of 10 Gold and and requires a character. Explorations needs 270 days to prepare but this can be reduced by the Diplomatic ability of the character leading the exploration. Once an exploration has started, it will take a number of years to complete depending on area's distance from the country capital and the terrain of its locations. The duration of the exploration can be reduced by increasing the country's naval range as well as the Military ability of the character leading the exploration. Explorers, which are characters that start with explorer traits, can be recruited after the Explorer Commissions advance has been researched. \nThe first time a country with the capital within the continent of Europe, Asia or Africa discovers an area from the continent of America it will receive +20 Prestige, +5 Research Progress, and a scaled amount of Gold. \nExplorations can be started either from the Geopolitics tab or by right-clicking on Terra Incognita within naval range.",
